# Changelog

All notable changes to DocWrite are documented here, one entry per release.
Format: `## vX — Theme` followed by what shipped.

## v6 — Lists
- Bullet list and numbered list toggle buttons
- Nested lists via Tab (nest) / Shift+Tab (un-nest), using StarterKit's
  built-in list-item keymap
- Verified the Tab precedence concern flagged in v5: ListItem's Tab handler
  returns false outside a list, so it correctly falls through to the v5
  Indent extension for regular paragraphs — no conflict, nothing to fix

## v5 — Paragraph Formatting
- Text alignment: left, center, right, justify
- Line spacing selector (1, 1.15, 1.5, 2) via TipTap's bundled LineHeight extension
- Indentation: custom extension (no stable official one exists yet), with
  increase/decrease buttons and Tab/Shift+Tab shortcuts
- Note: Tab-to-indent may need a precedence check later once list items
  (which also use Tab, for sinking) land in v6

## v4 — Font Controls
- Font family selector (Default, Serif, Sans, Mono)
- Font size selector (Small, Normal, Large, Huge)
- Text color swatches (7 preset colors)
- Highlight color swatches with a "none" option to clear
- Corrected TipTap 3 extension imports (TextStyle/FontFamily/FontSize/Color
  ship bundled in `@tiptap/extension-text-style`, not as separate packages)

## v3 — Text Basics
- Formatting toolbar: bold, italic, underline, strikethrough
- Buttons highlight active state based on cursor/selection
- Standard keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+B, I, U) work via TipTap's built-in bindings

## v2 — Editor Core
- Rich-text editing engine (TipTap/ProseMirror) wired into the `/editor` route
- Live cursor position and selection-length tracking
- Placeholder text on empty document
- Tailwind Typography plugin added for prose-based content styling

## v1 — Project Foundation
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind project scaffold
- Installable PWA: web manifest, app icons, offline-capable service worker
- Base routing: home (document dashboard), editor (placeholder), settings (placeholder)
- Dark-themed base layout, mobile-safe-area aware viewport config
